    "The above is used in Shuffle pahse. During the shuffle phase, MapReduce partitions data among the various reducers.\n",
    "An implementation of Partitioner takes the key and value of the record, as well as the total number of reduce tasks, and returns the reduce task number that the record should go to. By default, MapReduce uses HashPartitioner, which calls hashCode() on the key and returns the result modulo of the number of reduce tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The combiner gives applications a chance to apply their reducer logic early on. As the map phase writes output, it is serialized and placed into an in-memory buffer. When this buffer fills, MapReduce will sort the buffer and then run the combiner if the application has provided an implementation for it. After the shuffle, each reducer will have one input for each map. The reducer needs to merge these inputs in order to begin processing. It is not efficient to merge too many inputs simultaneously. Thus, if the number of inputs exceeds a certain value, the data will be merged and rewritten to disk before being given to the reducer. During this merge, the combiner will be applied in an attempt to reduce the size of the input data. \n",
